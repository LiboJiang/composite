A dissection model for mapping complex traits

Data in txt format that poplar-V, poplar-HT, poplar-DIA, poplar-marker represent volume, height, diameter, and marker of populus deltoids, respectively. 

Data.R represents equation 7 in the article.
Data-mix.R represents equation 11 in the article.


Data in csv format that final 10, final 11, final 12, and Map-Genotype represent overall length, number, average length of the lateral root of populus euphratica.

Data-2. R and Data-2-len. R are the analysis for the lateral root.

Permu_2.R is the permutation test for the testcross.

Par-100-5.R is the computer simulation under heritabilities (H2=0.05) and sample size (n=100) at three hypothesized genotypes by the dissection model


The other procedures are the plots of the figures. Fig-S2 and fig-S3 is the similar procedure.
